# Social Sharing Buttons - do not track 
Social Sharing plugin for WordPress - Simple sharing buttons without tracking  

When you add or embed standard sharing buttons using the normal embedding scripts from the popular social networks, it includes a tracking feature, so in some cases it doesn't matter if people uses the sharing button, they are still tracked. And if you look for sharing button plugins for WordPress it is a typical feature to have data collection for usage and behavioural statistics build into the plugin.

To avoid the data collection from third parties Privacore created a simple plugin for the Privacore website to get sharing icons for twitter, Facebook and Linked in on the posts. 

The plugin makes it possible to add meta data for sharing by adding a field group on pages and posts, and ca be added by default, and individually by controlled on each post. 

## Feature overwiev
